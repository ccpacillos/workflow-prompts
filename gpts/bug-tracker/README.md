# Bug Tracker GPT
These artifacts can be used to create a Bug Tracker GPT, which is a specialized AI assistant designed to help project managers or similar roles create bug tasks on ClickUp and the corresponding entry in a Google Sheet tracker. This also synchronizes the bug status between ClickUp and Google Sheets.
