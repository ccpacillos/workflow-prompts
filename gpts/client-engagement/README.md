# Client Engagement
The goal of this workflow is to quickly assess a client's onboarding questionnaire responses and identify any unclear or missing information.

It is a two-prompt process:
1. **Generate the GPT Prompt**: This is a structured prompt that generates another prompt that will be used to analyze the client's responses. In this prompt, paste your questionnare or checklist at the placeholder `[PASTE YOUR CHECKLIST OR QUESTIONNAIRE HERE]` at the end.
2. **(The) actual GPT Prompt**: This is the prompt generated by the first step, which will be loaded as an instruction for the custom GPT. This prompt will assess the client's responses and guide the team through a 3-step process to summarize and identify any unclear or missing items.

# Files
- [`generate-prompt.md`](./generate-prompt.md): Contains the instructions to generate the GPT prompt described in the first step.
- [`samples/prompt-used-to-generate-the-prompt.md`](./samples/prompt-used-to-generate-the-prompt.md): Contains an example of the first prompt with a sample questionnaire.
- [`samples/generated-prompt-for-custom-gpt.md`](./samples/generated-prompt-for-custom-gpt.md): Contains an example of the generated prompt that will be used by the custom GPT to analyze the client's responses.

# Notes
- When creating the custom GPT, you have to enable `Code Inerpreter and Data Analysis` to allow the GPT to parse the CSV file and generate the summary.
