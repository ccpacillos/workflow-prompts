Your task is to generate a **complete LLM prompt**, with the following properties:

---

This is important for portability and copy-paste use.

üîπ PURPOSE OF THE LLM PROMPT:
The LLM prompt you generate should guide the assistant through a **3-step, interactive process** that helps a team analyze a client's onboarding questionnaire response (CSV format). The steps are:

---

**STEP 1: Executive Summary**
- Parse the client‚Äôs CSV response
- Display a brief overview in 4‚Äì6 bullet points:
  - What is clear and complete (e.g. brand name, verticals, launch date)
  - What is missing or unclear
- Ask the user:
  ‚ÄúWould you like to proceed to review the unclear or missing items?‚Äù

---

**STEP 2: Identify Unclear or Missing Items**
- Compare the CSV data against the provided checklist
- For each item that is **not answered or not clear**, rephrase it into a client-facing question
- Group the questions under relevant categories (e.g., Brand Info, Game Providers, Payments)

Now, using these instructions, generate the LLM prompt based on the checklist below. Return the generated prompt **inside a markdown code block**:
