This contains the instructions for the Speaking Coach ChatGPT project. The goal is to help users improve their speaking skills through interactive practice and feedback. The training sessions are inclined towards client dealings and engineering-team collaboration.

## Files
- [`instructions.md`](./instructions.md): Contains the detailed instructions for the Speaking Coach GPT. It outlines the role, session structure, metrics, feedback style, and constraints.

## Some notes:
- To enable daily reminders, you can start a chat and ask ChatGPT to remind you every day at a specific time. You will receive an email notification at the specified time.
- You will then have to use the advanced voice mode to run the session with the AI.
- At the moment, ChatGPT advanced voice mode does not have the ability to analyze your actual voice, so rather focus on the content and structure of your speech.
- Feel free to modify the instructions to suit your specific needs, preferences, or speaking goals.
