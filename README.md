# 🗂️ Prompt-Collection

A curated set of text prompts I use across day-to-day product, engineering, and automation workflows.

They’re written to be copy-pastable into LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) or embedded in scripts/agents.

## ✨ Why this exists
- **Reuse** – I find myself rewriting the same prompts; this repo centralizes them.
- **Quality** – Version-controlled history makes it easy to iterate, review changes, and roll back.
- **Sharing** – This is a public collection, so others can benefit from my work.
